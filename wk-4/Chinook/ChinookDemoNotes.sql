-- this is SQL
-- for comments

-- when nothing is highlighted, and we run/execute everything in the current query is run
-- you can select only a specific command, and only run that one

SELECT * FROM Customer;
-- when you make a query to a DB, any result will take the form of a table

SELECT 'Hello World';
-- single quotes mark a string literal

SELECT 2 + 2;

SELECT SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- USUALLY nothing in SQL is case sensitive
select 2 + 2;

-- semicolons are not a required end-line character. they are an end of operation/end of thought. and are not generally required.
SELECT 2 + 2


SELECT Address FROM Customer;
-- SELECT (Columns) FROM (Table)
--          ^ select-list


-- Column Alias 
-- great for concatenating multiple columns together.
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName, Address FROM Customer;
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName, Address FROM Customer;
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'FullName', Address FROM Customer;
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS [FullName], Address FROM Customer;


-- filtering with WHERE

SELECT * -- get this column
FROM Customer -- from this table
WHERE LEN(FirstName) > 5; -- for entries that meet this condition

SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE Country = 'Brazil' AND City = 'SÃ£o Paulo';

SELECT *

-- Aggregate Functions

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Customer;

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM Invoice;

-- other agg functions include min, max, avg

SELECT CustomerId, SUM(Total)

SELECT CustomerId, SUM(Total) AS Sum_Total
FROM Invoice
WHERE BillingCountry != 'USA'
GROUP BY CustomerId
