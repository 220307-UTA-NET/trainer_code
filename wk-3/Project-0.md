# project 0: store application

## functionality
* interactive console application
* place orders to store locations for customers
* add a new customer
* search customers by name
* display details of an order
* display all order history of a store location
* display all order history of a customer
* input validation
* exception handling
* persistent data (no prices, customers, order history, etc. hardcoded in C#)
* (optional: order history can be sorted by earliest, latest, cheapest, most expensive, etc.)
* (optional: get a suggested order for a customer based on his order history)
* (optional: display some statistics based on order history)
* (optional: asynchronous network & file I/O)

## design
* don't use public fields
* define and use at least one interface
* documentation with `<summary>` XML comments on all public types and members (optional: `<params>` and `<return>`)

#### customer
* has first name, last name, etc.
* (optional: has a default store location to order from)

#### order
* has a store location
* has a customer
* has an order time (when the order was placed)
* can contain multiple kinds of product in the same order
* rejects orders with unreasonably high product quantities
* (optional: some additional business rules, like special deals)

#### location
* has an inventory
* inventory decreases when orders are accepted
* rejects orders that cannot be fulfilled with remaining inventory
* (optional: for at least one product, more than one inventory item decrements when ordering that product)

### test
* at least 10 test methods
* focus on unit testing business logic; testing the console-app-specific parts is low priority
